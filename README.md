## 📚 Project Origin

This restaurant landing page was originally built during a front-end development course using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
While the original course materials are no longer available, the structure and design were adapted and expanded based on what I learned. 
All code has been reviewed, reorganized, and documented in English for global accessibility and recruiter-friendly presentation.
